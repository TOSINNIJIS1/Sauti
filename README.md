# Sauti

The App is made mainly for Africa, but honestly, it works world wide with no limit.

There will be more update in the future since some feature still need to be implemented.

How To Use.

You create new account if you are new or log in if you already have account.

The remaining is simple since there's only four navigation on the dashboard which include your profile page.

You can update your username or password, even your profile picture, it's fun; you should try it.

You can add new product with or without picture.

You can edit the product but you can't delete it for now. . . That's one of the feature that will be updated in the future.

you can check the market price, and if there's no product . . . well, you just create one.

The Webpages was designed by Jacquetta Bommuluri. github handle @jacquetta. and developer by you know who . . . yes me. Vincent Adeniji. @Tosinnijis1
